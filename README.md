# Hello, my name is Fleet King. This is my GitHub profile!
# I'm a student at Oregon State University Cascades in Bend OR. 
# My goal is to work remotely as a software engineer and travel. As a kid, I was always fascinated by computers and wanted to know how they work. As I work hard toward being a developer I learn more every day.

# Goals
# I am currently learning Python, but I also want to be proficient in C++, Swift, HTML, JS, and CSS. 

# Projects
# I don't have any major projects right now, hopefully soon. 

# Hobbies
# In my free time, I am a photographer for Athletezone, Oregon State Athletics, and Cascades Media. 

# I started a nonprofit company with my dad called Ocean Blue Project, an ocean cleanup organization that is working to rehabilitate and conserve the world's oceans, beaches, and rivers.

# When the winter comes around, I am a regular on the slopes. Living so close to Mount Bachelor is great because after I finish a project, I can de-stress on the mountain.
